# Create-GitHub-account 

GitHub is a web-based centralized system for repositories. It used by millions of people to work on millions of projects. Although it is not a direct part of the Git project, it is very rare that one might escape it. Not only hosting the repositories but many other functions such as issue tracking, code review, etc. can be done on GitHub with GitHub Account.

This chapter is about the first step in contributing to the world where so many collaborations happen in a day. We will learn about creating our account and logging in to GitHub throughout this tutorial. 

# Setting Up GitHub Account

Setting your GitHub account is easy and very simple. To set the account visit GitHub's official website.

The login form will appear on the same page. Fill out the form with your details to create an account on GitHub. 


Note: GitHub will warn you if there are any duplicate entries i.e. if that username is already taken by some other individual or not etc. Along with the error, GitHub will suggest you the available attributes also. For example, your username could be duplicate because whatever you are thinking as your username, might have been already taken by someone else. 

Once you press Sign up for GitHub button, you will be prompted to verify that you are not a robot. 
In GitHub, you will be known by your username. So, it has to be unique. 

# GitHub Account Dashboard

Now that the GitHub account is all set up, you can log in through your credentials on the GitHub's website. Logging in will land on the GitHub dashboard which is personalized for everyone according to interests.

A GitHub dashboard will contain three sections. 

1.GitHub Repositories
